\chapter{Introduction}

\fancyhead[RE, LO]{Eric Andrew Appel\\ \it Chapter 1 - Introduction}
\fancyhead[RO, LE]{Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis\\ University of Cambridge}


Supramolecular chemistry \cite{Lehn:1995p2342, Cram:1974p2474, PEDERSEN:1988p2572} is an extremely fast growing field, which focuses greatly on the concept of self assembly on the molecular level. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Dynamic, Supramolecular Polymers}
\noindent
Despite extreme initial skepticism facing macromolecular science in the early 20th century, the development of polymers over the past century has had a dramatic and indispensable impact on human life and earned a Nobel Prize for Hermann Staudinger in 1953.\cite{Staudinger:1953p3048}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\\
\subsection{Characteristics}
\noindent
In order to look at the general characteristics of SPs, certain limitations are necessarily required for the definition of `supramolecular polymer'. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{Non-covalent interactions and macro-SPs}
\noindent
As the characteristics of SPs are dependent almost exclusively on the non-covalent interactions existing between monomers, it is important to look at the self-assembly toolbox to identify advantages and limitations existing in each of the three major categories in the formation of SPs: (a) hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), (b) metal-ligand coordination (MLC) and (c) macrocyclic host-guest complexation (MHGC).

\section{Cucurbit[8]uril: A Host of Opportunities}
\noindent
Although it was first synthesized more than a century ago,\cite{Behrend:1905p1004} the structure of the synthetic host molecule cucurbituril (CB) was not elucidated until the 1980s.\cite{Freeman:1981p990}

\section{RAFT Polymerization}

\noindent
`Living' polymerization techniques have made enormous advances since the inception of anionic polymerization in 1956 by Szwarc {\it et.~al.}~\cite{Szwarc:1956p46, Szwarc:1956p55}

\chapter{Results and Discussion}

\fancyhead[RE, LO]{Eric Andrew Appel\\ \it Chapter 2 - Results and Discussion}
\fancyhead[RO, LE]{Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis\\ University of Cambridge}



\section{The Search for a Simple Path to Functional RAFT CTAs}

\noindent
Initial efforts focused on the synthesis of trithiocarbonate (TTC) CTAs useful for RAFT polymerization that carry Np or M2V functionality.  



\section{Functional Water Soluble Polymers}

With several RAFT CTAs in hand it was now possible to prepare functional polymers.



\section{Supramolecular Polymer Assemblies in Water}


As several functional polymers of various types were now in hand, it was time to determine the capacity of the polymers to complex with M2V and CB[8].


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\chapter{Conclusions}

\fancyhead[RE, LO]{Eric Andrew Appel\\ \it Chapter 3 - Conclusions}
\fancyhead[RO, LE]{Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis\\ University of Cambridge}



Mono- and bis-Np functional RAFT CTAs have have been synthesized and have demonstrated to successfully confer control over the polymerization of a variety of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and stimuli-responsive monomers with excellent control over targeted molecular weight and PDI. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\chapter{Outlook and Future Work}

\fancyhead[RE, LO]{Eric Andrew Appel\\ \it Chapter 4 - Outlook}
\fancyhead[RO, LE]{Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis\\ University of Cambridge}

The development of functional RAFT CTAs that provide facile preparation of either semi-telechelic and telechelic polymers that can be dynamically interlinked with CB[8] offers many opportunities for further investigation into hierarchical self-assembly.
