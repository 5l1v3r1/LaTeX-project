# ACS Templates

This is the template for ACS journals. The template files are downloaded
here, but the links for convenience are provided here as well:

 1. The template homepage[1]
 1. LaTeX style files [2]
 1. LaTeX instructions and sample files [3]
 1. support package [4]
 1. achemso package [5]

If any link [2-4] is broken, use the home page link [1]. If that is broken
as well, then please google for the link with search 'ACS LaTeX publishing'
and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she
could update the links.

The style files [2] and the support package [4] should be already available in
your LaTeX distribution, so at first try downloading only the instructions and
sample files [3]. For inpatient the achemso [5] package should do all the
necessary things, but please read the documentation before using it.

Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
