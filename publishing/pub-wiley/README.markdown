Wiley-VCH Templates
=========

This is the template for Wiley-VCH publishing. There is only a template for
Wiley-VCH book publishing and for articles it is more tricky and some templates
can be found on this repo. The links:
    * The template homepage[1]
    * LaTeX template archive for books [2]

If the template link [2] is broken, use the home page link[1]. If that is broken
as well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for Wiley-VCH
journals' and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that
he/she could update the links.

Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
