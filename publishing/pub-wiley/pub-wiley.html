    Here you can find some templates for some Wiley-VCH journals.
    The journals are supported by means of a template made during this project.
    This is <b>not</b> an official template, but it should produce a document, which should resemble their .dot templates for MS Word.
    However, they seem to offer LaTeX support for books, and you can download the templates from their website.
    Links on their website:
  </p>

  <ol style="padding-left:3em;">
    <li><a href="http://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/authors/auguidelines/">Their page for authors</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wiley-vch.de/util/latex/wileyvch.zip">Template for books</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If the template link [2] is broken, use the home page link[1]. 
    If that is broken as well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for Wiley-VCH journals' and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she could update the links.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is only one template for manuscript preparation.
    This is because the paper size, layout of the text is all the same in all Nature Publishing Group journals.
    The options in the package just just some colours, so if it causes any problems, this feature might be removed.
