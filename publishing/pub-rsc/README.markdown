RSC Templates
=========

This is the template for RSC journals. The template files are downloaded here,
but the links for convenience are provided here as well:
    * The template homepage[1]
    * LaTeX Communication template [2]
    * LaTeX full paper template [3]
    * LaTeX Faraday template [4]
    * BibTeX styles [5]

Actually BibTeX styles [5] are a package called rsc, which should already be in
your LaTeX distribution.

If any link [2-5] is broken, use the home page link[1]. If that is broken as
well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for RSC journals' and
please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she could
update the links.

Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
