    Here you can find templates for most (if not all) ACS journals.
    The journals are supported by means of achemso package, which is unofficial, but recognised by the ACS publishing house.
    For getting the templates, please follow the following links:

    </li>

  <p>
    If any link [2-4] is broken, use the home page link. If that is broken
    as well, then please google for the link with search 'ACS LaTeX publishing'
    and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she
    could update the links.
  </p>
  <p>
    The style files [2] and the support package [4] should be already available in
    your LaTeX distribution, so at first try downloading only the instructions and
    sample files [3]. For inpatient the achemso [5] package should do all the
    necessary things, but please read the documentation before using it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
    page[1].
