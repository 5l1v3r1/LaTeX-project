Nature Publishing Group Journals {.title}
--------------------------------

Â 

Here you can find templates for some NPG journals. The journals are
supported by means of a template, which was created during my project.
The templates were created just to ease the preparations for the
submition, but it should not be relied to much! After your manuscript is
accepted, a Nature style will be implied upon and they will take care of
all formatting for you. That is why, your document should compile with a
standard document class (e.g. article, scrartcl, revtex or similar).

1.  [The homepage for the submission
    matters](http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/index.html)
2.  [Nature biblatex
    package](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex-contrib/biblatex-nature)

There is only one template for manuscript preparation. This is because
the paper size, layout of the text is all the same in all Nature
Publishing Group journals. The options in the package just just some
colours, so if it causes any problems, this feature might be removed.

The links bellow will download you the necessary files.
