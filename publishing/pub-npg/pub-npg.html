    Here you can find templates for some NPG journals.
    The journals are supported by means of a template, which was created during my project.
    The templates were created just to ease the preparations for the submition, but it should not be relied to much!
    After your manuscript is accepted, a Nature style will be implied upon and they will take care of all formatting for you.
    That is why, your document should compile with a standard document class (e.g. article, scrartcl, revtex or similar).

    <li><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/index.html">The homepage for the submission matters</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex-contrib/biblatex-nature">Nature biblatex package</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    There is only one template for manuscript preparation.
    This is because the paper size, layout of the text is all the same in all Nature Publishing Group journals.
    The options in the package just just some colours, so if it causes any problems, this feature might be removed.
