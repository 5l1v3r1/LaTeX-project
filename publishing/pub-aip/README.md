Here you can find ways of how to prepare papers for the AIP journals The
journals are supported by means of the REVTeX document class.
The REVTeX should already be installed by installing the latest TeX
distribution on to your computer.
If you do not have REVTeX installed, then please do it through your system
package manager to install required TeX Live modules or through MiKTeX package
manager to install the REVTeX itself just by searching revtex.
The download links of REVTeX listed bellow are just for completeness.
