# LaTeX Template and Teaching website project

This was a summer project after my first year at the University of Cambridge.
I have not maintained these templates for a long time, so expect because because of new package versions.

However, I will do my best to update them, but it might take a while.

    * cls, sty and bib files for
        Part III, GPGS, MPhil and PhD Thesis LaTeX templates
    * common journal cls and sty and bib files.
    * template for CV

## List of Journals covered

    * All ACS (American Chemistry Soc) journals
    * All NPG (Nature Publication Group) journals
    * Wiley VCH journals (Angew Chem, etc)
    * Science journals
    * PNAS journals
    * RSC journals

## Thesis writing

    * Include the templates for the journals

## Report (CPGS, PtIII) writing

    * Report writing
        Template from CUED website
    * fix the template from Eric to make the code better.
