\section{Introduction}

\LaTeX{} is a very good tool for this purpose as the files are created in ASCII
format and everybody can read it the same way.

\section{What is version control system (VCS)?}

There are many models of VCS, but the main idea in all of them remains the same.
This is the ability of registering the changes to the files. A typical workflow
can be described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Repository is initialized with initial files.
    \item Then a person copies the repository
    \item makes some changes to the files
    \item submits them back to the repository 
    \item clever algorithms detect  which part(s) of the files were altered 
    \item The files are updated and the changes being made are saved
    \item Go back to point 2.
\end{enumerate}

As you see from this description it is clear that the whole history of how the
files were changing is saved and, thus, they can be restored to any previous
state. In addition to this being such a good back up tool, there are several
other advantages one should be aware of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It takes much less space than having multiple folders with different
        versions of the files
    \item One can spot what was changed much more easily
    \item People can work on different parts of the file at the same time.
\end{itemize}

The last feature is the most useful for \LaTeX{} users once they need to work
together with someone.

\section{Using GIT and \LaTeX{}}

\section{Using other VCS solutions}

Using other VCS solutions is possible and highly recommended for people, who
find GIT too hard. One very good alternative with slightly more intuitive
command syntax might be Mercurial.

There are also another VCS, which should be abandoned because of their
inefficiency and limitations, but the fact is that they are still around. Those
are Subversion (SVN) and CVS.
