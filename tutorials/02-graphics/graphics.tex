\title{Getting good quality graphics inside a \LaTeX\ document}

\section{Introduction}

For publications and scientific articles, reports and thesis the most important
thing is to make well looking graphics. For that there are several guidelines,
which help one to get his figures look professionally, but at the same time not
to overdo things as there is a limit of how good the quality has to be.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use vector graphics as much as possible. Especially where there is a
        lot of text in the figure. But remember, if you 'convert' a jpg to eps
        or svg or any other vector graphics format, you will \textbf{not} gain
        any quality. More on this, please use
        \href{http://www.google.co.uk}{Google}
    \item If you have to use raster graphics, please select \verb|png| format as
        a better alternative where possible
    \item If you use raster graphics, do not exceed the final resolution of the
        picture to more than 600dpi as most of the printers are printing at
        300dpi or 600dpi, so anything more than that might just be wasted time
        while waiting the figure to be rendered. Of course if you have a good
        reason why you need more than 600dpi, then go ahead.
    \item Have a high quality copy of your figure somewhere in your computer.
        This is because while converting from one format to another one can
        \textbf{not} improve the quality.
\end{enumerate}

If you feel that you have not found enough information on the graphics usage in
\LaTeX, please refer to these websites:

\section{Inserting a simple figure}

Inserting a figure is a really easy task and it can be accomplished with the
following code. Note, that there is an option to the \verb|\includegraphics|
command which scales the image, so that its width would not exceed the text
width.
\lstinputlisting{fig1.tex}
And our figure will look as follows:
\input{fig1.tex}

\section{Directory setting for graphics, their formats and \LaTeX\ compilers}

The most convenient way nowadays to produce documents from \LaTeX\ source code
is to use the \verb|pdftex| or \verb|pdflatex| compiler. It is because it
produces a \verb|.pdf| file directly and you do not need to convert the
\verb|.ps| file every time before viewing it with a viewer. Also with
\verb|pdflatex| you can use more graphics formats:
\begin{description}
    \item[.pdf] This is the native graphics vector format for this compiler
    \item[.eps] This format also can be used with pdflatex, but you need to use
        the \verb|epstopdf| package, which will convert them to \verb|pdf| files
        on the fly. There are also options to make the convertion only when the
        \verb|.eps| figures are changed, which speeds up everything
        substantially.
    \item[.png, .jpg] At last you can use this format too if you need to import
        raster graphics into your document, which might ease a lot of things.
\end{description}

For all these features, one should use the \verb|graphicx| package as this is
the recommended way to do it. What is more, this packages provides some other
useful commands. You can tell it where to search for figures by issuing the
\lstinline|\graphicspath{{./path/to/your/directory}}| command. What is more, you can
specify several directories in the following way
\lstinline|\graphicspath{{./dir1}{./dir2}}|. The symbols \verb|./| mean, that the top
directory is where the \verb|.tex| file is located. So if you have the following
directory structure:
\begin{lstlisting}
some document
    |-figures
    |-mytexfile.tex
\end{lstlisting}
you will need to issue \verb|\graphicspath{{./figures}|. The preamble of this
file contains the following lines:
\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{./figs/}}
\usepackage[update,verbose=false]{epstopdf}
\end{lstlisting}

The options for the \verb|epstopdf| package mean, that it will convert the
\verb|.eps| graphics only when they are updated and it will not output any
errors.

\section{Overlaying a figure with \LaTeX\ code}

Although there are different ways of how to overlay text onto graphics, I will
examine only one of them - the \verb|TikZ| package, which seems to be much
easier to use and more powerful than the native \LaTeX\ \verb|picture|
environment.

\subsection{TikZ package}

Let's look at the example bellow, which has to do more with chemistry than the
figure \ref{fig:plot1}. The thing, which we want to do is to put 4 structures
and then label them. The final image is shown in the figure \ref{fig:struct1-2},
where the work-flow is explained in the figure \ref{fig:struct1-1} on page
\pageref{fig:struct1-1}.

\input{fig3-2.tex}
\input{fig3-1.tex}

You can check out the code listing for creating the figure \ref{fig:struct1-1}
bellow:
\lstinputlisting{fig3-2.tex}

This way one can create good figures very easily. What is more, if you have just
simple structure images you do not have to worry about placing them correctly
using your mouse or making sure that the font will be the same as in all the
other text if you overlay everything using this \LaTeX\ package.

There is another example shown in the figure \ref{fig:struct2}. This is a true
scientific quality figure and with overlaying text on top you ensure, that it
will be readable in your document.
\input{fig4.tex}
