Tables is usually the most difficult thing to do \emph{properly} in \LaTeX{}. 
%
It is because there is a number of ways to compose your text inside a cell and
    the basic functionality, which is provided by \LaTeX{} does not always suit
    the requirements.
%
It is very hard to cover everything needed to get nice tables in your document,
    so if you feel, that this tutorial have not answered your questions, please
    refer to this
    \uurl{https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/LaTeX/Tables\#The_table_environment_-_captioning_etc}{book}.

\section{Simple table usage}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

%
In this section you can find two simple tables, which are made using slightly
    different methods --- the table \ref{tab:table1} is made using the internal
    \LaTeX{} commands, while the table \ref{tab:table2} is made using the
    \pkg{booktabs}, which seems to provide better looking tables.

%
\input{tab1.tex}
\input{tab2.tex}

%
As you can see, the table \ref{tab:table2} looks far better, because of
    different spacing and line widths.
%
The tables were produced using the code shown bellow:
%
\lstinputlisting{tab1.tex}
\lstinputlisting{tab2.tex}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Multiple lines in table cells}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

%
The basic method of constructing tables which was covered in the previous
    section is good only if you do not need to specify the width of the columns
    and you do not need to break the text inside a cell.
%
Suppose we add one more column into our table and make use of the ability in
    provided by the \pkg{array} package to get any environments working inside a
    cell.

\section{Tables in documents with more than one column}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \input{tab5.tex}

    Usually scientific journals use two-columns text layout, which sometimes
        complicates float placement inside text. 
    %
    This is because not all figures can be made narrow enough to fit into one
        column of text and if it needs to be larger, then we get some nasty
        overlapping, which is the least we want.

    %
    The ``trick'' there is to use a 'stared' version of the \cmd{table}
        environment (i.e. \cmd{table*}). 
    %
    However, this has some limitations as the table float then can be added only
        to the top of the page. 
    %
    A package \pkg{stfloats} seems to offer slightly more flexibility over the
        placement as it provides means to put the float on the bottom of the
        page, however, the float still can not be placed in the middle of the
        page.
    %
    The package \pkg{floatrow} can even take care of the caption placement
        automatically and it supersedes the packages \pkg{stfloats},
        \pkg{float}, which makes it a very powerful alternative.

    %
    In my opinion these options are the only one which look really good, so I do
        not see any limitations here, it is just it is slightly harder to deal
        with such floats than with simple floats.
    %
    Because I need more text, I will insert some dummy text using a package
        \pkg{blindtext} and a command provided by this package ---
        \pkg{blindtext}.

    \textbf{Dummy text start}
