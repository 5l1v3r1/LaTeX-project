So defining compound \cmp{cmp:benzene} and \cmp{cmp:naphtalene} is
    very easy.
%
Referencing them (Compound \ref{cmp:naphtalene} and \ref{cmp:benzene}) is also
    easy.
%
Look at the figure \ref{fig:compeg} to see how you can incorporate it
    into figures.

        Although this thing was done using the \pkg{TikZ} package, the same
            would work with other methods, such as overpic package or others, it
            is just that the alignments of the labels might be somewhat more
            difficult.
