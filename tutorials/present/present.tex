Here I will talk as to how get \LaTeX\ working for the production of the
presentations. There are numerous ways how you could do a presentation in
\LaTeX{}. One of
them is to use already existing packages, of which \verb|beamer| is the most
popular one. However, you can use standard document classes as well
\cite{PracTeX-komapres}.

There is also another source of information \cite{latexwikibook:presentations},
which might be a good starting point for example of Beamer package.

\section{Beamer package}

As mentioned before, the \verb|beamer| package is the most popular among
scientists and it works quite well with PGF/TikZ packages which might make it
the best solution out there. It is very straight forward to use it --- it
defines several new environments (eg \verb|frame|, \verb|column| etc) and
commands (eg \verb|\frametitle|, \verb|\pause| etc).

In order to make your presentation stand out from other people, it might be
advisable to read the aforementioned article \cite{PracTeX-komapres}, which
might help you a lot in understanding how to make your presentation good and
unique.

\section{KOMAscript class}

This way seems to be much more extensible and faster once it is learned,
however, appear to have slightly higher learning curve than the \verb|beamer|
just because of these options.
