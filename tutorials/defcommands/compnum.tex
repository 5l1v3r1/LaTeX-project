So defining compound \cmp{cmp:benzene} and \cmp{cmp:naphtalene} is
very easy.  Referencing them (Compound \ref{cmp:naphtalene} and
\ref{cmp:benzene}) is also easy.
Look at the figure \ref{fig:compeg} to see how you can incorporate it
into figures.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \setlength{\tikzunit}{.085\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0,x=\tikzunit,y=\tikzunit]
% ---- Draw a grid which should help to position things -----------
%        \draw[step= .5,color=gray,thin,dashed] (-4,-4) grid (4,4);
%        \draw[step=1.0,color=gray]             (-4,-4) grid (4,4);
%        \draw[step=4.0,color=black]            (-4,-4) grid (4,4);
%  Notes:
%       just uncomment the lines with draw commands and the grid
%       will appear.  The commands, I believe are self explanatory
%       and it can be drawn as big as you want. The two coordinates
%       denote lower left and upper right corners of the grid.

        \node(0,0){\includegraphics[width=7\tikzunit]{4struct.eps}};
        \draw ( 2.1, 0.5) node{\cmp{cmp:naphtol}};
        \draw (-2.1, 0.5) node{\cmp{cmp:TNT}};
        \draw (-2.1,-3.5) node{\cmp{cmp:mCPBA}};
        \draw ( 2.1,-3.5) node{\cmp{cmp:TsCl}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Overlaying \LaTeX{} commands on top of the figure. To
    get the correct numbers we used a newly created
    \texttt{cmp} command. As you see the order of the numbers is
    determined by the order of code execution.}
