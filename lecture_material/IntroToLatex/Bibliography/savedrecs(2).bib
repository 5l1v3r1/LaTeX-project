Abstract = {{Fibrillogenesis of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) is a seminal
   pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease, Inhibiting fibrillogenesis
   is thus one approach toward disease therapy, Rational design of
   fibrillogenesis inhibitors requires elucidation of the stages and
   kinetics of A beta fibrillogenesis, We report results of studies
   designed to examine the initial stages of A beta oligomerization, Size
   exclusion chromatography, quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy,
   and electron microscopy were used to characterize fibrillogenesis
   intermediates, After dissolution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and removal
   of preexistent seeds, A beta chromatographed almost exclusively as a
   single peak, The molecules composing the peak had average hydrodynamic
   radii of 1.8 +/- 0.2 nm, consistent with the predicted size of dimeric
   A beta. Over time, an additional peak, with a molecular weight
   >100,000, appeared, This peak contained predominantly curved fibrils,
   6-8 nm in diameter and <200 nm in length, which we have termed
   `'protofibrils.'' The kinetics of protofibril formation and
   disappearance are consistent with protofibrils being intermediates in
   the evolution of amyloid fibers, Protofibrils appeared during the
   polymerization of A beta-(1-40), A beta-(1-42), and A
   beta-(1-40)-Gln(22), peptides associated with both sporadic and
   inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that protofibril
   formation may be a general phenomenon in A beta fibrillogenesis. If so,
   protofibrils could be attractive targets for fibrillogenesis inhibitors.}},
