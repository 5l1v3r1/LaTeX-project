Welcome to the LaTeX webpage at the Department of Chemistry. Here you
will find LaTeX templates for a variety of common purposes, including
frequently used journal templates, and a series of tutorials on specific
aspects of LaTeX to help you learn LaTeX and also to benefit from other
peoples experience.

Also, please feel free to use the [forum](forum) if

-   you have a LaTeX question that is not answered somewhere on the
    website.
-   you have a suggestion for improvements to the templates.
-   you wish to request a new template.
-   you wish to share a new LaTeX trick that you have discovered!

At the moment the easiest way to clone the entire repository is to use
the [git][1] [Distributed Version Control System][2]
More information on how this can be done easily is described in the [git
tutorial](../tutorials#git) which can be found [tutorials
section](/latex/tutorials). Notes on how to do this can be found in the
same [git tutorial](/latex/tutorials#git).

Note that the current "git" repository setup will change in the nearest
future to probably a subversion repository on the Departmental servers.

If you have another other comments about the content of this website
please email .

Enjoy the website and Happy Latexing.

Yours Sincerely

Ignas Anikevicius, 2011

PS thanks to Dr. Oren A. Scherman for funding me to create this site
during Summer 2011. I hope it will serve the department for many years
to come!"
