Welcome to the LaTeX Homepage of Chemistry Department of University of
Cambridge. This thing is currently being hacked by Ignas Anikevicius and
he will need quite some time before anything can become tolerably nice.
At the moment I am trying to put something, which would not be terribly
bad and then I will just try to adjust the looks of it.

This is the way LaTeX and this website is/will be done.
