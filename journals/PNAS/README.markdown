PNAS Templates
=========

This is the template for PNAS journals. The template files are downloaded here,
but the links for convenience are provided here as well:
    * The template homepage[1]
    * LaTeX template [2]
    * LaTeX Class file [3]
    * LaTeX Style file [4]
    * Documentation [5]
    * Sample .tex file [6]
    * Sample .pdf file [7]
    * Image for the sample .tex file [8]

If any link [2-8] is broken, use the home page link[1]. If that is broken as
well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for NPAS journals' and
please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she could
update the links.

Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
