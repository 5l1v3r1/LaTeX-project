Wiley-VCH Templates
=========

This is the template for Wiley-VCH journals. The template files are downloaded
here, but the links for convenience are provided here as well:
    * The template homepage[1]
    * LaTeX template archive [2]

If the template link [2] is broken, use the home page link[1]. If that is broken
as well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for Wiley-VCH
journals' and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that
he/she could update the links.

Also, if not sure about the version, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
