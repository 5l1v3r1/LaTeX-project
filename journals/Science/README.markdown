Science Templates
=========

This is the template for Science journal. The template files are downloaded here,
but the links for convenience are provided here as well:
    * The template homepage[1]

However, Science journal is very picky and they do convert your PDFs to HTML and
to Word (do not know why they are doing this). And it is probably best to go to
the home page and read through everything before doing anything. Still, for
those people, who know everything, the template files are provided in this
repository.
    * The same info as found on the homepage[1], just as pdf format[2]
    * LaTeX template for manuscripts [3]
    * Compiled version of the template as .dvi [4] and .pdf [5] files
    * .sty[6], .bst,[7] .bib[8] files
    * older version[9] of the .sty file

If any link [2-9] is broken, use the home page link[1]. If that is broken as
well, then please google for the link with search 'LaTeX for Science journal'
and please let the maintainer of the website know about this so that he/she
could update the links.

Also, if not sure about the files, please check for updates at the home
page[1].
