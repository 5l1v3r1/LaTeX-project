% This is a Template for CPGS and Part III Reports for the Department of
% Chemistry. It should be used as a starting point to typeset your reports.
% Everything is set up in the preamble, so that the changes would be easy to
% make. However, if you are happy with the formatting, do not change anything
% unless you really know what you are doing.
%
% For those who want to learn more LaTeX and know how everything was done,
% please read through the preamble and enjoy. I hope that the extensive
% documentation will help you to understand everything. If you can think of a
% better way to do things, please submit a patch to the file and I will be happy
% to ammed the changes.
