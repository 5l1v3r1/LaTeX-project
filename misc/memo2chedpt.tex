{\large \bfseries Dear members of the Department Chemistry,}
    
This summer I am working on a departmental project to compile a LaTeX repository/website for the
Department of Chemistry.

I would like to produce a final product (website) that will serve all members of the department from
Part III students to group leaders containing all things that are Chemistry and LaTeX related.

\paragraph{The preliminary list of the content includes:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty and .cls files to produce a
        Cambridge Department of Chemistry PhD thesis, CPGS report and part III project report (NB
        here I would really like to get input and hopefully have several examples which can be used
        for interested students)

    \item notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty, .cls files for writing
        communications/articles/reviews for all journals where academics publish in this department:
        ACS, NPG, Wiley-VHC, Science, NPAS, RSC and other journals.  (I would love to get your input
        here!!!)

    \item notes, links, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX 

    \item notes, links on how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX 

    \item any other requests or ideas?
\end{itemize}

I was wondering if you could spare some time to meet with me and give some input about what you
would like to see on this website. It will help to refine the content of the website and no doubt
improve it's usefulness to members of the department.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

\hfill        Ignas Anikevicius
