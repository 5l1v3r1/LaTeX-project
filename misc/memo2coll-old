Dear Administration of the College,
    
At the moment I am working on a website for the Department of Chemistry which
would be dedicated for the production of scientific articles, reports and
thesis. One of the requirements of the members of the Department, was to include
crests of Colleges on the title page of some reports and especially thesis.

I have found many crests on wikipedia [1] pages and most of them were of quality
suitable for publications. However, I was in doubt of whether the University and
most importantly, the Colleges are recognizing the crests to be valid?

However, some of the crests where not of required quality and I would like to
ask you kindly if it would be possible to receive an official crest of the
College of high resolution, or even better, in vector graphics format (.svg,
.ps, .eps)? I can assure you that this would be used only for the departmental
crest database which would be a part of my summer project.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
        Ignas Anikevicius
