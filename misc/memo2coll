Dear Administration of the College,
    
This summer I am working on a project under Dr. Oren Scherman to compile a LaTeX
repository/website for the Department of Chemistry. The final product (website)
will become a helpful tool to produce scientific articles, reports, theses,
posters and presentations using the LaTeX typesetting system. One of the
wishes of the members of the Department, was to include crests of the Colleges
in the repository, which could be easily accessed using a Raven password.

I have found an official identifier of the University of Cambridge [1] and I was
wondering whether Colleges have similar identifiers which could be included in
the repository. I would be very grateful if you could send me an .eps image of
the crest of your College, or at least give me any directions to whom shall I
write or where could I download the crests from.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Ignas Anikevicius

Dear Sir/Madam,
    
This summer I am working on a project under Dr. Oren Scherman to compile a LaTeX
repository/website for the Department of Chemistry, which is intended for the
production of scientific articles, reports and theses using the LaTeX
typesetting system. One of the requirements of the members of the Department,
was to include crests of Colleges on the title page of some reports, especially
PhD theses.

I have found many crests on Wikipedia [1] pages and most of them were of quality
suitable for publications. However, I was in doubt of whether they are
recognized by the University and Colleges themselves and some of them did not
match the ones found on the websites of the Colleges.

Also I have found another source [2] of the college crests, which seem to be a
much closer replication of the actual ones. However, I have not checked whether
they are of a reasonable quality and the same questions remain as with the
previous sources.

Therefore, I am writing to you with a kind request of whether you could send me
and image with the Crest of your College, or at least give me any directions to whom I
should write or where could I download them from.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Ignas Anikevicius
