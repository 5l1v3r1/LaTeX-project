Dear ...

     I am Ignas Anikevicius, the summer student who will work on compiling all relevant and useful information on using the LaTeX typesetting system for writting thesis, reports, articles for scientific papers, etc.

     In order for the project to succeed, I would like to meet as many people as possible using or wanting to use LaTeX and hear their thoughts on what they would like to see included in the repository and the website. The exact content will very much depend on the requests and recommendations and it would be great if the end product would be useful for both, students and academics.

     I understand that most of the people are occupied with probably more important matters, so I think, that my flexibility might help to find the best time slot.

     Looking forward to hearing from you,
     Ignas Anikevicius
