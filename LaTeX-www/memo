Dear ...

     I would like to let You know, that I have started my summer project on a LaTeX repository/website dedicated for writting thesis, reports, scientific papers, etc.

     The objective is to creat a good reference website for searching various information when needed and puting useful LaTeX templates so that lateron they could be reused and in this way a lot of time could be saved. It would also contain a startup guide for people who are new to LaTeX, but who would like to use its powerful capabilities.

     In order to further increase the usefulness of the website, I would like to meet as many people as possible using or wanting to use LaTeX. Your thoughts on what should be included would determine the final content and possibly the structure of the repository and the website.

     I understand that most of the people are occupied with probably more important matters, so I think, that my flexibility might help to find the best time to meet.

     Looking forward to hearing from you,
     Ignas Anikevicius
