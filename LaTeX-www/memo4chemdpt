Dear members of Chemistry Department,
     
    I would like to let You know, that I have started my summer project on a
    LaTeX repository/website for the Department of Chemistry.

    The preliminary list of the content includes:
        * notes, templates and other usef info on writing thesis, reports.
        * notes, links, templates, .sty, .cls files for writing articles to
          numerous scientific papers (ACS, NPG, Willey-VHC and others).
        * info, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX
        * info on how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX.

    I am hoping that you could spare some time for meeting and talking about
    what would you like to see on this website. It will help to refine the
    content of the website and probably improve the usefulness of it.

    Looking forward to hearing from you, 
    Ignas Anikevicius
