Dear members of the Department of Chemistry,

This summer I am working on a project under Dr. Oren Scherman to compile a LaTeX
repository/website for the Department of Chemistry.

I would like to produce a final product (website) that will serve all members of
the department from Part III students to group leaders containing all things
that are Chemistry and LaTeX related.

The preliminary list of the content includes:

    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty and .cls files
      to produce a Cambridge Department of Chemistry PhD thesis, CPGS report
      and Part III project report (NB here I would really like to get input and
      hopefully have several examples which can be used for interested students)

    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty, .cls files
      for writing communications/articles/reviews for all journals where
      academics publish in this department: ACS, NPG, Wiley-VHC, Science, NPAS,
      RSC and other journals. (I would love to get your input here!)

    * notes, links, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX 

    * notes, links on how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX 

    * any other requests or ideas?

If you use LaTeX and have some spare time to give input on what would you like
to see on this website, please do contact me. Sharing any templates or other
relevant information which could then be included into the website would be also
very appreciated.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
        Ignas Anikevicius
