Dear members of the Department Chemistry,

This summer I am working on a departmental project to compile a LaTeX
repository/website for the Department of Chemistry.

I would like to produce a final product (website) that will serve all members of
the department from Part III students to group leaders containing all things
that are Chemistry and LaTeX related.

The preliminary list of the content includes:

    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty and .cls files
      to produce a Cambridge Department of Chemistry PhD thesis, CPGS report
      and part III project report (NB here I would really like to get input
      and hopefully have several examples which can be used for interested
      students)

    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty, .cls files
      for writing communications/articles/reviews for all journals where
      academics publish in this department: ACS, NPG, Wiley-VHC, Science,
      NPAS, RSC and other journals. (I would love to get your input here!!!)

    * notes, links, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX 

    * notes, links on how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX 

    * any other requests or ideas?

I was wondering if you could spare some time to meet with me and give some input
about what you would like to see on this website. It will help to refine the
content of the website and no doubt improve it's usefulness to members of the
department.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
        Ignas Anikevicius
