LaTeX-www
=========

IDEAS:
------
* The website should be created with Drupal
* Where scripting is needed, use python and Drupy
* Make it possible to edit how tos and other things through raven access
* Do some mockups before doing everything
* Write how tos with LaTeX and convert it to HTML using latex2html
    as written in one site.

TODO:
-----
    Find a good template (either Wiki, or something similar and OSS)
    Integrate the git repo well in the website
    Dynamic generation of the fields from the files
