Dear ...

     I am Ignas Anikevicius, the summer student who will work on compiling all relevant and useful information on using the LaTeX typesetting system for writting thesis, reports, articles for scientific papers, etc.

     In order to increase the usefulness of the website, I would like to meet as many people as possible using or wanting to use LaTeX. Your thoughts on what should be included would determine the final content and possibly the structure of the repository and the website.

     I understand that most of the people are occupied with probably more important matters, so I think, that my flexibility might help to find the best time to meet.

     Looking forward to hearing from you,
     Ignas Anikevicius
