Dear Scherman Group members,

     I would like to just let You know, that I have started my summer project on
     a LaTeX repository/website dedicated for writing thesis, reports,
     scientific papers, etc.

     This website repository can contain (the list is not final!):
        * info on writing scientific papers to all relevant journals
        * info on writing thesis
        * info on writing reports
        * templates for speeding up tedious and manual work
        * info on how to set up a LaTeX installation.

     I would like to meet you when possible and ask about your usage of LaTeX:
        * What templates would you like to have 
        * What things took you a lot of time
            and you would liked them to be easier

     If you would like to help me by just talking with me, please, let me know
     when you are available and when/where could we talk about this.

     Looking forward to hearing from you, 
     Ignas Anikevicius
