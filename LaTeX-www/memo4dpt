Dear members of Chemistry Department,
    
I would like to produce a final product (website) that will serve all members of
the department from Part III students to group leaders containing all things
that are Chemistry and LaTeX related.

The preliminary list of the content includes:

    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty and .cls files
        to produce a Cambridge Department of Chemistry PhD thesis, CPGS report
        and part III project report (NB here I would really like to get input
        and hopefully have several examples which can be used for interested
        students)
    * notes, links, templates, instructions and downloadable .sty and .cls files
        to produce manuscripts for several scientific journals (ACS, NPG,
        Willey-VHC and others)
    * notes, links, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX notes, links on
    * how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX any other requests
    * or ideas?

I was wondering if you could spare some time for meeting and talking about
what you would like to see on this website. It will help to refine the
content of the website and no doubt improve it's usefulness to members of
the department.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
        Ignas Anikevicius
