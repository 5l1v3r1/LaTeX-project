Dear members of Chemistry Department,
     
I would like to inform you that I have started my summer project on a
LaTeX repository/website for the Department of Chemistry.

The preliminary list of the content includes:

    * notes, templates and other useful information on writing thesis and
        reports
    * notes, links, templates, .sty, .cls files for writing articles to
        numerous scientific papers (ACS, NPG, Willey-VHC and others)
    * info, templates on how to produce a CV in LaTeX
    * info on how to properly set up a computer to start using LaTeX

I was wondering if you could spare some time for meeting and talking about
what you would like to see on this website. It will help to refine the
content of the website and no doubt improve it's usefulness to members of
the department.

Looking forward to hearing from you, 
        Ignas Anikevicius
